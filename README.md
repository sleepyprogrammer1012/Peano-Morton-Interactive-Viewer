# Peano–Morton Interactive Viewer

---

An interactive Python tool for exploring ternary (or generalized base‑N) Morton / Peano interleaving.
It lets you visualize space‑filling curves, step through indices, and experiment with arithmetic operations on Morton codes.

---

## ✨ Features

• 	Slider to change recursion order (1–6)

• 	Play/Pause button to animate filling the curve

• 	Auto‑centered + padded viewport

• 	Arithmetic buttons (–1, ×3, ÷3) to manipulate the current Morton index

• 	Red highlight dot that shows the current index on the curve

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Requirements

• 	Python 3.8+

• 	numpy

• 	matplotlib

---

Install dependencies:

`pip install numpy matplotlib`

Run: 

`python peano_morton_fill_centered.py`

---

## 🎮 Controls

• 	Slider: Adjust recursion order

• 	▶ Play / ⏸ Pause: Animate the curve filling

• 	–1 / ×3 / ÷3: Step through Morton indices interactively

• 	Red dot: Shows the currently selected index

---

## 📚 Why it matters
Morton (Z‑order) codes are widely used in:

• 	Spatial indexing (databases, GIS)

• 	Graphics and texture mapping

• 	Cache‑friendly data layouts

• 	Scientific computing

This viewer makes the abstract math visible and interactive.
